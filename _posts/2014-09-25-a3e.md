This week I spent two days in Boston at the [A3E Advanced Audio & Application Exchange][a3e] conference. This was the inaugural conference for A3E and as far as I could tell it was a great success. Paul Sitar and Doug DeAngelis (with the help of many others not the least of which was Lori Lawlor) started a conference from the ground up that served a need that everyone I spoke with agreed was not being filled.

Early on in the planning I was tapped to be on the Advisory Board of A3E. When I was first asked the only other person on the board was my good friend [David Mash][mashine] from [Berklee College of Music][berklee]. The board grew from there including a number of industry heavy-hitters such as Chris Halaby of [KVR][kvr], Chanel Summers of [Syndicate17][s17] and Ernst Nathorst-Böös of [Propellerhead][propellerhead]. Other companies that were involved included Avid, Fishman, Gibson, Google, Izotope, Line6, Microsoft, Native Instruments, Roland, Smule, Sony, Yamaha and others - oh yea, and my company [Zobcode][zobcode] - a nice list to be a part of!

I met a number of attendees and companies coming to show their wares before and during the conference and the one thing I noticed the most is that everyone - with no exception - was extremely happy to be there, meeting people, interacting with other developers and artists at the level the conference provided. It was truly a very interactive, creative and relaxed environment. An exchange of ideas - exactly what the developers and musicians look for.

I also, personally, met people from a number of unique backgrounds in the world of audio and music software development. There was the expected developers writing apps for mobile and desktop, others worked in more scientific disciplines dealing with DSP and still others were working on products and services to be used throughout the industry such as royalty management systems. It was an extremely eclectic group of very talented people.

Along with a number of keynotes, sessions and panels there was also an excellent concert at the Berklee Performance Center featuring a number of speakers and others. An informative discussion with electronic music artist [BT][bt] and a trans-atlantic interview with [Imogen Heap][imogenheap] helped complete the conference.

Bottom line - keep an eye out for this conference next year. If you are an audio developer or an artist who has an interest in taking the next step in the world of apps and software you will want to be there!
